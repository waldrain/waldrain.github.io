Questions to the photovoltaik planner:
How to connect the PV strings so that the shading has as little influence as possible
Can the inverter(s) deal with a possible parallel connection?
What are the advantages and disadvantages?
Does it make sense to occupy the 2 other available roof areas (south but small) and southeast, or at least to design the current system so that a later expansion is possible?
Please consult the attached photos.
If the manufacturer of the solar modules and of the storage system cannot do the individuel planning of the project: Is there another service provider who can do it?
RegEnergieConsult, can you help find a company who can install the whole photo voltaik and storage system?
